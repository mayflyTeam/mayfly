# jamsocket-api

10/16 - This is our first attempt at coding up the API. We are doing it as a mob. We agreed that the API was part of an MVP. Its possible to expand the MVP to a CLI and container registry. Right now we're assuming the MVP is for two users on a single machine with a single container (container image). The API interacts with the Plane API.
